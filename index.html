    <h2>Who is Alex Atanassov?</h2>
    <p>Hello. My name is Alex Atanassov and I'm currently a student learning JavaScript and Front-end Web Development in AP Comp Sci. I don't have much coding exprience, I learned a bit of C++ while coding an Arduino in STEM class last year, and I also know a tiny bit of Python. I'm a pro at pcpartpicker so if you ever need a list I'm your guy. I also use a scissor keyboard. By choice. Yes, you are going to hate me for this, but I specifically went out and bought the only gaming scissor switch keyboard: the <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1404172-REG/cougar_vantar_scissor_switch_rgb_keyboard.html">Cougar Vantar</a>. And I like it. Deal with it.</p>
